# Emotion-Detector
A complete NLP pipeline for detecting emotions in text using classic ML models (MLP, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression) and various linguistic features (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, POS tagging). Includes preprocessing, feature engineering, evaluation, and real-time prediction support.

# üòÉ Emotion Detection from Text using Machine Learning

This repository showcases a full Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for detecting **emotions in text** using classic machine learning models. From data preprocessing to real-time deployment, the project highlights feature extraction techniques, model evaluation, and user-friendly execution through a graphical interface and `.exe` app.

## üß† Project Overview

Emotion recognition from text has impactful applications in sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, customer service, and intelligent chatbots. This project classifies emotional states such as:

- üòä Joy
- üò¢ Sadness
- üò† Anger
- üò± Fear
- üòê Neutral

I built and trained ML models on labeled emotion datasets using linguistic features like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and POS tagging.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of short English text phrases, each labeled with one of several emotion categories such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, or neutral.

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Text`      | The raw text input (e.g., sentence or phrase) |
| `Emotion`   | The labeled emotion for each sample (e.g., joy, anger, fear) |

## üîÑ Data Processing Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset Preparation**
- Load the labeled emotion dataset.
- Shuffle and split data for training and evaluation.
- Handle class imbalance if present.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Text Preprocessing**
- Convert text to lowercase, remove stopwords and special characters.
- Tokenization and lemmatization.
- POS tagging for syntactic feature extraction.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering**
- Generate text features using:
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
  - Bag-of-Words
  - Word2Vec Embeddings
  - POS tag counts

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Development & Training**
- Trained and compared the following machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Used pipelines and `joblib` to save and reuse models.
- Visualized performance with confusion matrices and classification reports.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
